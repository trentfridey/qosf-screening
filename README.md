Tasks submitted in application to the [QOSF](https://qosf.org/) [Mentorship program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/)

Task 1 explores the efficiency of QAOA-style circuit in preparing a given quantum state. It uses the `numpy` and `autograd` python libraries.

Task 2 explores the effects of noise on preparing an entangled state using a variational quantum circuit. It uses the `pennylane` QML library with the `cirq` simulator
